# Raspberry Pi AC Controller (IR)

## Overview

The repository houses code for a basic IR transmitter which is programmed to use
codes that will interact with my AC unit.

## Components

1. Raspberry Pi with WiFi dongle and SD card (case, if you please)
2. Half-size breadboard
3. Jumper cables
3. 1 IR 5mm LED
4. 1 220 Ohm resistor
5. 1 10k Ohm resistor
6. PN2222 transistor
7. IR receiver for testing
8. A minor amount of programming skill

## The System

The AC unit has a hard constraint that it should not be turned on within 3
minutes of turning it off. Let's keep that in mind as we design.

Let's build an API to "press the buttons" on the raspberry pi IR remote.

## Hardware Setup
